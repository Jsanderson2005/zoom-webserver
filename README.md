# zoom-webserver

A webserver written in flask to control and run zoom in macOS. (windows and linux is possible, you would just have to change the keybinds and commands in `zoom-libary.py`)

To make this run, make sure your default webbrowser automatically open zoom links. Also, Make sure you turn off the 'video prompt' and the 'call with internet audio' prompt. Lastly, make sure you enable global keybinds for mute/unmute, video, switching views, fullscreen and meeting chat.


To install dependencies run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```



and to run the program run:

```
python3 main.py
```
